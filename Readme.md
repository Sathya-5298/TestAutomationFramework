# Java Test Automation Framework

This Java-based Test Automation Framework is designed for efficient test execution.

It supports data-driven testing, cloud-based test execution like Lambda test, headless mode for faster execution, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

Before running this framework, ensure the following softwares are installed on system:
- **Java 11** installed and configured
- **Maven** installed (mvn --version to verify)
- **TestNG** installed (mvn test should execute test cases)
- **LambdaTest** account (if running on the cloud)

## Features

- **Test Execution:** Utilizes TestNG for structured test execution.

- **Data-Driven Testing:** Supports CSV, JSON, and Excel data sources using OpenCSV, Gson, and Apache POI.

- **Cloud Testing:** Runs tests on LambdaTest.

- **Cross Browser Testing:** Runs tests on different browsers.

- **Headless Mode:** Enables fast execution without GUI rendering.

- **Logging & Reporting:** Uses Log4j for logging and Extent Reports for HTML-based test reports.

- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrated with Jenkins (AWS EC2) and GitHub Actions.

```

**Parameters**

**browser:** Browser type (e.g., chrome, firefox, edge...)

**isLambdaTest:** Boolean to enable or disable LambdaTest execution

**isHeadless:** Boolean to enable or disable headless mode

**Running Tests on Local in Headless mode with chrome browser:**

```bash
    mvn test -X -Dbrowser=chrome -Dislambdatest=false -Disheadless=true
```

**Running Tests on Lambda Test(Cloud) with chrome browser:**

```bash
    mvn test -X -Dbrowser=chrome -Dislambdatest=true -Disheadless=false
```

## Generating Reports
After test execution, reports will be generated in the report.html file located in the ./reports.html.

## Logging
Logs will be stored in the logs directory as specified in the ./logs/automation.log

## Integrated project with Github Actions
This TestAutomationFramework is integrated with github actions and tests will be executed at 11:30pm IST every single day.
